This repository contains the files necessary to order these boards from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).  
Please be aware that JLC does not have a great track record when it comes to SMT part assembly.  
Crane had several of these boards manufactured and had about a 5% failure rate so order at your own risk.  
I am not responsible if you recieve defective boards.

The following is a short guide on the ordering proccess
