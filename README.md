# Model-U

The Model-U is a USBC breakout board designed by [Crane](https://github.com/Crane1195).  

It is specificly designed for use with DIY rectangle controllers  
If you need a wiring guide please check out the [Crane's Lab Discord](https://discord.com/invite/S3qgZWD)  

This repository contains the files necessary to order these boards from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).  
Please be aware that JLC does not have a great track record when it comes to SMT part assembly.  
Crane had several of these boards manufactured and had about a 5% failure rate so order at your own risk.  
I am not responsible if you recieve defective boards.  

The following is a short guide on the ordering proccess  

1. Download the files from this github by clicking on "Code" and then on "Download Zip". Unzip the "Model-U-main.zip" but do not unzip the "Model-U_panel.zip" folders

2. From the JLCPCB home page click on "Order now"

3. On the next page click the "Add gerber file" button and select one of the "Model-U_panel.zip" files in the "Model-U JLC Files" folder. For this guide I'm using the 10 piece panel

4. Change the delivery format to "Panel by Customer" and then input the amount of rows and columns needed, for the 10 piece panel it is 2 columns and 5 rows

7. On this page just leave everything default and click "NEXT"

8. The final step will show you a preview of what the boards will look like. It is normal for the parts to be off center and only displayed on one board. JLC will place the parts correctly after you place the order. All you have to do now is click "SAVE TO CART" and then finish the checkout process
